# Using Preact Signals with Fresh

[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) is the Deno full-stack framework created by [Luca Casonato](https://github.com/lucacasonato) of the Deno core team and now [hosted in the Deno github repository](https://github.com/denoland/fresh).This blog post assume you have some familiarity with Fresh. If not, see the [Fresh documentation](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/introduction) to get up to speed.

Fresh uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com) for the UI. Recently the Preact team has released a new library called [Signals](https://preactjs.com/blog/introducing-signals/) for reactive state management. Preact Signals are used for both global and local state management.

This post will demonstrate how to use Signals with Fresh. I created a basic Fresh Todo app to illustrate the use of Preact Signals. The source code can be found [in this Github repo](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-todo-signals).

## Global State Management with Preact Signals

### Setup

As of Fresh version 1.1, when you [create a new fresh project](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started/create-a-project) the signals libraries are automatically added to the import map file.
If you are updating a Fresh project to use Signals, add the following lines to the `imports` section in your import map:
```json
{
  "imports": {
    # other imports here
    "@preact/signals": "https://esm.sh/*@preact/signals@1.0.3",
    "@preact/signals-core": "https://esm.sh/*@preact/signals-core@1.0.1"
  }
}
```
All the Signals functions we will be using are located in the `@preact/signals` module.
## Creating global state

The Todo app encapsulates global state management inside a function called `createAppState` (in [`state.ts`](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-todo-signals/blob/main/state.ts)). The `signal` function is used to add a field to global state:
```ts
function createAppState(): AppStateType {
  // create signals for todo array and current todo
  const todos = signal<string[]>([]);
  const currentTodo = signal<string>("");
  // other stuff here...
  return {todos, currentTodo, /* Other function properties here...*/}
}
// function return value is the default export
export default createAppState();
```
In this case, the current todo (`currentTodo`) and a todos array (`todos`) are held in an object returned by `createAppState`. Each call to the `signal` function takes an object or primitive argument that represents the initial value of that signal.

Functions that update the signals are also contained in `createAppState` (`addTodo` and `removeTodo`) and made available to other modules in the return value of that function (also note the TypeScript type `AppStateType` defined in [state.ts](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-todo-signals/blob/main/state.ts)).
```ts
function createAppState(): AppStateType {
  // ... todos, current todos signals created here  as is todoCount ...

  const addTodo: AddTodoFunction = (e: Event): void => {
    e.preventDefault();
    todos.value = [...todos.value, currentTodo.value];
    currentTodo.value = "";
  };

  const removeTodo: RemoveTodoFunction = (index: number): void => {
    todos.value = todos.value.filter((_todo: unknown, i: number) =>
      i !== index
    );
  };
  return { todos, currentTodo, addTodo, removeTodo, todoCount /* todoCount explained below */ };
}
export default createAppState();
```

We will be using the `createAppState` function to pass signals and functions to the app's components. Ths done through the Preact
Context (similar to React Context). Application state -- including the signals previously created -- is added to the context in the root component `App` (see [`App.tsx`](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-todo-signals/blob/main/islands/App.tsx)) using a context provider:
```ts
import { createContext } from "preact";
import state, { type AppStateType } from "../state.ts";

// create the AppState context
export const AppState = createContext<AppStateType>({} as AppStateType);

export default function App() {
  return (
      <AppState.Provider value={state}>
      // Components that use the state here ...
      <AppState.Provider>
  );
}
```
The `state` field in the `App` module is the return value of the `createAppState` function (see [`state.ts`](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-todo-signals/blob/main/state.ts)). `AppState.Provider` is a Preact context provider which exposes `state` to the rest of the app enclosed within its component tree.

The `state` held in the context can be accessed by any of the app's components with the `useContext` function. Here it is used by the `TodoList` component to access the list of todos:

```ts
import { useContext } from "preact/hooks";
import { AppState } from "./App.tsx";
import Todo from "./Todo.tsx"

export default function TodoList() {
  // Destructure state to expose the todos signal
  const { todos } = useContext(AppState);
  return (
    <div className="todos">
    // use the value property to obtain the todos array
      {todos.value?.map((item: string, i: number) => {
        return (
          <Todo text={item} index={i} />
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```
### A Signal's value
The object returned from a call to `signal` always contains a `value` field which is the current value of the signal. In the Todo app there are signals for all todos (`todos`, an array of strings) and the current todo (`currentTodo`, a string). The value of `todos` is obtained from this expression: `todos.value`.

The `value` property can also be used to set the value of a signal. There is no built-in setter like there is in the `useState` hook. Signal value mutation is done in the `addTodo` and `removeTodo` functions. The same thing can be done outside the app state object returned from `createAppState`. This is what is done in the input's `onChange` handler in `AddTodo.tsx`:
```ts
  <input
    { /* other attrs missing here... */}
    value={currentTodo.value}
    onChange={(e) =>
      currentTodo.value = (e.target as HTMLInputElement).value}
  />
```
Note that the type coercion of the event target is needed because of a [bug](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/1930) in the current Preact TypeScript typings.


### Using the computed function
The function `computed` is included in the Preact Signals module. Signals that are used within `computed` are subscribed to the signal and notified when the signal's value changes. That allows `computed` to derive values based on the value of one or more signals. When `computed` is notified of a signal value change, it automatically re-runs the callback function sent in as an argument. An example is found in the `createAppState` function in `state.ts`:
```ts
  const todoCount = computed(() => todos.value.length);
```
When `todos.value` changes, the callback function gets re-run and `todoCount` gets updated with the new count.

## Local state with Signals

The use of local signals is illustrated with the [Counter.tsx](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-todo-signals/blob/main/islands/Counter.tsx) component that I've piggy-backed on to the Todo app for illustrative purposes.

The `Counter` component counts button clicks and stores the counts in local storage so the current count can be recovered when the page is reloaded. Preact Signals is used to hold local state in this component.

Using signals for local state requires use of the `useSignal` hook. There is also a `useComputed` function that can be used for local computed values.

This is how the `Counter` component holds component state:
```ts
export default function Counter() {
  const COUNT_KEY = "COUNT";
  const count = useSignal<number>(parseInt(localStorage.getItem(COUNT_KEY) ?? "0"));
  // other code here...
}
```
The count is stored in local storage, so when the count signal is instantiated using `useSignal`, it pulls the count from local storage if it exists. Note that `useSignal` is for local state, while `signal` is used for global state. Also note that `useSignal` does not return a setter function like `useState`. The state value can be obtained from the signal (`count.value` in this case) and that value can be mutated directly as occurs in this button's `onClick` handler (in `Counter.tsx`):

```ts
  <button onClick={() => {
    count.value = 0;
    localStorage.setItem(COUNT_KEY, "0");
    }}>Reset Count</button>
```

The `useComputed` function is used for computing new values based on one or more signal's value. It is used for local state calculations, while `computed` is used for global state calculations. Both variations are subscribed to any signal that is contained within its function argument, so when the signal is updated, both  `useComputed` and `computed` function arguments are automatically invoked. In the case of the `Counter` component, `useComputed` is used to calculate the counter value squared. Any time that a signal changes, the `useComputed` function is re-run if it uses that signal (`count` in `Counter.tsx`).
```ts
  const square = useComputed(() => count.value * count.value);
```


### The effect function
The `effect` function in the `signals` module is used to handle side effects like `useEffect`. However, `effect` does not have a dependency array like `useEffect`. Instead the effect is subscribed to signals contained within the callback function, so when a signal's value changes, the `effect` function is notified of that change and the callback is invoked. In `Counter`, the effect is used to update the count in local storage.
```ts
  const dispose = effect(() => {
      localStorage.setItem(COUNT_KEY, count.value.toString());
      console.log(`Double: ${square.value}`)
    });
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      // free-up effect's memory
      dispose();
    };
  }, []);
```
The `effect` function returns a function (called `dispose` in this case) that can be used to invalidate the effect and free up memory that it uses. In this case we call `dispose` in the function returned by `useEffect` which gets called when the component is unmounted.

An `effect` can be nested inside another `effect`. Then you can make sure the signal only runs once like this:
```ts
// From Ryan Carniato stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRtrS_SvR4w&t=10909s
let dispose;
effect(() => {
  // clean up signal after it runs once
  if (dispose) dispose();
  // outer side effect here
  dispose = effect(() => {
    // inner side effect here
  });
});
```
In this code, the first time the outer `effect` callback is invoked, the `dispose` function is not run because it has not been assigned a value, but after the inner `effect` callback is invoked, then the outer `effect` disposes it.

The `effect` function can be used to work with both global and local state.

## Other functions in the Signals module

#### The batch function
The `batch` function is used to update multiple signals at a time for performance optimization. For instance, the todo array and current todo could be updated together in this manner:
```ts
batch(() => {
  currentTodo.value = "Another thing I have to do";
  todos.value = todos.value.push(currentTodo.value)
  });
```

#### The peek function
The `peek` function is attached to a signal's value. It is used to get the value of a signal without subscribing to the signal. Once `peek` is called on a signal, any updates to the signal's value are not passed along to the return value. For example:
```ts
const countNow = count.value.peek();
```
In this case, `countNow` will not be updated if `count.value` changes after the call to `count.value.peak`.
