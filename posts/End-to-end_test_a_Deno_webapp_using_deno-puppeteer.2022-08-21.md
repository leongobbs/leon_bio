# End-to-end test a Deno webapp using deno-puppeteer

The [`deno-puppeteer` library](https://github.com/lucacasonato/deno-puppeteer)
-- created by Deno team member Luca Casonato -- is a Deno-compatible port of the
[puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) Node (npm) library. The library has a number of
uses including generating app screenshots and automating form submissions. We
are using it here to do end-to-end (e2e) testing of a Deno webapp. The code for
this blog post can be found
[here](https://github.com/cdoremus/deno-blog-code/tree/main/using_deno-puppeteer).

## App Setup

Although puppeteer and deno-puppeteer can be used to e2e test any webapp, we are
going to test the default [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) app created with this
command-line (assuming [Deno](https://deno/land) has been installed):

```bash
deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev using_deno-puppeteer
```

The new project will be found in the `using_deno-puppeteer` folder. Moving into
that directory, the app can be started in that folder:

```bash
deno task start
```

The resulting page at `http://localhost:8000` looks like this:

## Using deno-puppeteer for e2e testing

### Imports

A `puppeteer.test.ts` file is created to hold the tests. Inside that file, the
deno-puppeteer library needs to be imported:

```typescript
import puppeteer, {
  Browser,
  Page,
} from "https://deno.land/x/puppeteer@14.1.1/mod.ts";
```

The `Browser` and `Page` classes are used in type annotations, while `puppeteer`
does the library's work.

We are going to use the `bdd` library in the deno_std testing module to run our
puppeteer e2e tests. That library includes the familiar functions `describe`,
`beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach` and `it` imported like this:

```typescript
import {
  afterAll,
  beforeAll,
  describe,
  it,
} from "https://deno.land/std@0.151.0/testing/bdd.ts";
```

We will also need assert functions found in the deno_std testing module to
verify test results:

```typescript
import {
  assert,
  assertEquals,
  fail,
} from "https://deno.land/std@0.151.0/testing/asserts.ts";
```

Finally, we need to add the `readlines` function from the standard `io` library
to capture subprocess stdout messages in a helper function (see below).

```typescript
import { readLines } from "https://deno.land/std@0.151.0/io/mod.ts";
```

### Test setup and cleanup

Behavior-driven development test libraries (like the popular
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) lib) include a `describe` function to wrap a test
suite and `it` for test functions. Also included are `beforeAll` and `afterAll`
functions used to initialize and cleanup test resources. These functions run
before and after all tests are run. There are also `beforeEach` and `afterEach`
functions to allow code to be run before and after each test runs (not used
here).

Our puppeteer tests have app server (`server`), `Browser` and `Page` objects
that need to be declared at the top of the `describe` block since they are used
in the `before' and 'after' functions.

```typescript
describe("e2e tests using puppeteer: ", () => {
  let server: { close: () => void };
  let browser: Browser;
  let page: Page;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    server = await startAppServer();
    browser = await startBrowser();
    page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.setViewport({ width: 400, height: 200 });
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await page?.close();
    await browser?.close();
    await server?.close();
  });

  // test functions next. . .
});
```

The app server, browser and page objects are used in all tests, so they are
initialized in the `beforeAll` function and closed in the `afterAll` function.
The `close` calls prevents the occurrence of 'leaking resources' errors. Make
sure that the page object is always closed before the browser object.

Note that the `server`, `browser` and `page` variables need type annotations to
avoid TypeScript 'implicit any' errors.

### Helper functions

The `startAppServer` and `startBrowser` functions abstract the mechanics of
starting the Fresh app server that serves the webapp and the puppeteer browser
which we will run in headless mode to allow the tests to run in a CI/CD
environment.

```typescript
/**
 * Run the Fresh server locally.
 *
 * @returns {{close: () => void}}: A handle to the server allowing closing of the server sub-process and
 * stdout/stderr within that.
 */
export async function startAppServer(): Promise<{ close: () => void }> {
  const serverProcess = Deno.run({
    // Fresh command line without the wait flag
    cmd: [Deno.execPath(), "run", "-A", "dev.ts"],
    cwd: Deno.cwd(),
    stdout: "piped",
    stderr: "piped",
  });
  console.log("Waiting for server to start...");
  //  Display some stdout messages.
  for await (const line of readLines(serverProcess.stdout)) {
    if (line.includes("Listening on http")) {
      console.log(line);
      break;
    }
  }
  return {
    async close() {
      await serverProcess.stdout.close();
      await serverProcess.stderr.close();
      await serverProcess.close();
    },
  };
}
/**
 * Start the puppeteer browser in headless mode
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Browser>}: Resolves to a puppeteer Browser instance
 */
export async function startBrowser(): Promise<Browser> {
  const browser: Browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: true,
    args: ["--no-sandbox"],
  });
  return browser;
}
```

### Test functions

Individual tests are found in `it` functions:

```typescript
it({
  name: "should display welcome message",
  fn: async () => {
    await page.goto("http://localhost:8000/", {
      waitUntil: "networkidle2",
    });
    const selection = await page.waitForSelector("body > div > p");
    if (selection) {
      const text = await page?.evaluate(
        (element: HTMLElement) => element.textContent,
        selection,
      );
      assert(text?.startsWith("Welcome"));
    } else {
      fail(`ERROR: Selector not found`);
    }
  },
});
```

Once the `page.goto` function runs and navigates to the page to be tested. All
tests in this file work on the same page. The `page.waitForSelector` is called
with a CSS selector pointing to the DOM node on the page to be verified. In this
case, we are verifying that a message that starts with 'Welcome' exists at that
spot. We use the `page.evaluate` to obtain the text content (i.e. the message)
from the HTMLElement.

The function of the counter component is tested in the next two test functions.
We want to know that the increment (+1) and decrement (-1) buttons work
properly.

```typescript
it({
  name: "should decrement counter",
  fn: async () => {
    await page.goto("http://localhost:8000/", {
      waitUntil: "networkidle2",
    });
    // TODO: Get counter text for later decrement comparison
    // click -1 button
    await page.click("body > div > div > button:nth-child(2)");
    // check to see if counter has decremented
    const selection = await page.waitForSelector("body > div > div > p");
    if (selection) {
      const text = await page.evaluate(
        (element: HTMLElement) => element.textContent,
        selection,
      );
      // counter should be 2 now
      assertEquals(text, "2");
    } else {
      fail(`ERROR: Selector not found`);
    }
  },
});

it({
  name: "should increment counter",
  fn: async () => {
    await page.goto("http://localhost:8000/", {
      waitUntil: "networkidle2",
    });
    // TODO: Get counter text for later increment comparison
    // click +1 button
    await page.click("body > div > div > button:nth-child(3)");
    // check to see if counter has decremented
    const selection = await page.waitForSelector("body > div > div > p");
    if (selection) {
      const text = await page.evaluate(
        (element: HTMLElement) => element.textContent,
        selection,
      );
      // counter should be 4 now
      assertEquals(text, "4");
    } else {
      fail(`ERROR: Selector not found`);
    }
  },
});
```

The `page.click` function is used to click a button found at the DOM node
defined by the CSS selector. Once the button is clicked, the DOM node containing
the counter's value is found and verified to have been incremented or
decremented (note that the Fresh app sets the counter's start value to 3).

### Test output

The command line to run all tests (`deno test --no-check-A`) has been
encapsulated in the `deno.json` file as task 'test'. You run that with
`deno task test`. When that is done, the following output should appear:

```shell
$> deno task test
Warning deno task is unstable and may drastically change in the future
Task test deno test --no-check -A
running 1 test from ./puppeteer.test.ts
Puppeteer e2e testing...  ...
------- output -------
Waiting for server to start...
Listening on http://localhost:8000/
----- output end -----
  should display welcome message ... ok (1s)
  should decrement counter ... ok (1s)
  should increment counter ... ok (1s)
Puppeteer e2e testing...  ... ok (4s)

ok | 1 passed (3 steps) | 0 failed (5s)
```

### Puppeteer API

There are a number of functions found in the
[Puppeteer API](https://pptr.dev/api/) that I have not covered here. Here are
few of the highlights:

- `Page.select` to target a drop-down or select element.
- `Page.type` to type text into an input box.
- `Page.waitForFunction` waits for a function to finish evaluating.
- `Page.screenshot` to take a screenshot of the current page.
- `Page.pdf` to create a pdf of the current page.

### Conclusion

As stated previously, complete source code for the example in this article is
available
[here](https://github.com/cdoremus/deno-blog-code/tree/main/using_deno-puppeteer).
Please note that the current versions of the libraries used in this example will
change with time.

While I used Fresh for this work, I learned how to use deno-puppeteer when I
created e2e tests for the [Ultra](https://ultrajs.dev) full-stack Deno
framework. I want to thank Omar Mashaal and James Edmonds for their assistance
in this effort.

I'd also like to thank Kyle June for reviewing previous versions of this post.

The deno-puppeteer library can now be combined with Deno's build-in testing
modules to allow the full
[testing pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)
to be done in a Deno-native way.
