# About Craig's Deno Diary

Welcome to my blog! I'll be blogging about the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime
[Deno](https://deno.land). This blog will be published periodically as my free
time allows.

I'm hoping to evolve the blog with new features and improved code quality as
time goes on. Source code can be found in this repo:
[https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-blog](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-blog).

If you want to support my efforts to create blog posts, please consider
[becoming a GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/cdoremus). Any financial
contribution will help. Thanks, in advance.

If you are interested in receiving updates on new blog posts, please follow my
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@deno_diary) feed. Also, DM me at cdoremus#4874
on Discord if you have any suggestions and ideas for this blog. I look forward
to hearing from you.
